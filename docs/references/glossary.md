# Glossary: Robotics & Physical AI Terms

This glossary contains definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

## A

### Action Space
The set of all possible actions that an agent can take in an environment. In robotics, this often corresponds to joint angles, motor commands, or high-level behaviors.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. In robotics, AI enables perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities.

## B

### Behavior Tree
A hierarchical structure used in robotics and AI to organize and execute complex behaviors. Behavior trees provide a modular and reusable approach to robot control.

## C

### Computer Vision
A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Cameras and algorithms identify and classify objects, and react to what they "see."

### Control Theory
A field of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems with inputs, and how their behavior is modified by feedback.

## D

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. It can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

### Differential Drive
A common wheel configuration for mobile robots that uses two wheels mounted on a common axis, with each wheel independently driven.

## E

### Embodiment
The concept that intelligence is shaped by the physical form and environment of an agent. Physical AI emphasizes the importance of embodiment in intelligent behavior.

## F

### Forward Kinematics
The computation of the end-effector position and orientation from known joint angles. The inverse problem is inverse kinematics.

## G

### Gazebo
A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides accurate physics simulation, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

## H

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a body structure that resembles that of a human, typically having a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics (IK)
Mathematical process for determining the joint parameters that achieve a desired position of the end-effector. The inverse of forward kinematics.

### Isaac Sim
NVIDIA's reference simulation application and synthetic data generation tool for robotics. Built on NVIDIA Omniverse.

## J

### Jacobian Matrix
In robotics, a matrix that defines the linear relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.

## K

### Kinematics
The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion.

## L

### LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances and create 3D maps of the environment.

### Localization
The process by which a robot determines its position and orientation in a known or unknown environment.

## M

### Manipulation
The branch of robotics dealing with the control of robot hands and arms to interact with objects in the environment.

### Mobile Robot
A robot that is capable of movement in its environment, as opposed to fixed robots like industrial arms.

## N

### Navigation
The process of planning and executing a path for a robot to move from one location to another while avoiding obstacles.

## O

### Omniverse
NVIDIA's simulation and collaboration platform based on Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) and NVIDIA RTX rendering technology.

## P

### Perception
The ability of a robot to interpret sensory information from its environment, including vision, touch, and other modalities.

### Physical AI
Artificial intelligence systems that interact with and manipulate the physical world, combining perception, planning, action, and learning.

### Planning
The process of determining a sequence of actions to achieve a goal, considering the current state and desired outcome.

## R

### Robot Operating System (ROS)
A flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior.

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
The second generation of the Robot Operating System, designed for production environments with improved security, real-time support, and multi-robot systems.

## S

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

### Simulation
The computational modeling of real-world processes in a virtual environment, often used for testing and training before deployment to physical systems.

## T

### Teleoperation
The remote control of a robot by a human operator, often used for tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for autonomous operation.

## V

### VLA (Vision-Language-Action)
A model architecture that combines visual perception, language understanding, and action generation in a unified framework for robotic manipulation.

### Vision-Language-Action Model
A type of AI model that can process visual input, understand natural language commands, and generate appropriate robotic actions.

## W

### Waypoint
A reference point used for navigation, typically a coordinate in space that a robot aims to reach as part of a path.

## Y

### Yaw
The rotation of a robot or object around its vertical axis, changing its heading direction.

## Z

### ZMP (Zero Moment Point)
A concept used in robotics and biomechanics to maintain balance in walking robots by ensuring the net moment of the ground reaction forces is zero.
