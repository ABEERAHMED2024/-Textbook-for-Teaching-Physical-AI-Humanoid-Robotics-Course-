# Week 6: Gazebo Simulation

## 6.1 Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is the industry standard for open-source robotics simulation. It allows you to test code in a 3D environment with gravity, friction, and sensor noise.

### Why Gazebo for Humanoids?
- **Physics Fidelity**: Uses engines like ODE and Bullet.
- **ROS 2 Native**: The `gazebo_ros_pkgs` bridge allows seamless communication.
- **Large Community**: Thousands of pre-built robot and environment models.

## 6.2 Building Worlds

A Gazebo "world" file (`.world`) defines the environment. It includes:
- **Gravity**: Direction and magnitude.
- **Physics**: Solver parameters.
- **Models**: Buildings, obstacles, and furniture.
- **Lighting**: Sun direction and ambient light.

## 6.3 Spawning Your Robot

To bring your humanoid (from Week 5) into Gazebo, you use the `gazebo_ros` spawn service. Your URDF must include `<gazebo>` tags for:
- **Sensors**: Attaching virtual cameras or LiDAR.
- **Plugins**: Adding controllers for motors.

## Exercise: Spawning a Mobile Robot

Try running the following command if you have Gazebo installed:
```bash
ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py
```
Then spawn a simple box or a pre-built robot model from the Gazebo library.

### Key Takeaways
- Gazebo provides the physical "grounding" for your code.
- Simulation is the first step in the Sim-to-Real workflow.
