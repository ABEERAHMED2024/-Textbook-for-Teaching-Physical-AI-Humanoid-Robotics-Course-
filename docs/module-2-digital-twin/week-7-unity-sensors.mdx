# Week 7: Unity for Photorealistic Simulation

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />
<Prerequisites prereqs={frontMatter.prerequisites} estimatedTime={frontMatter.estimated_time} />

## 7.1 Why Unity for Robotics?

While Gazebo is great for physics, its graphics are dated. For AI-driven robots that rely on **Computer Vision**, we need photorealism. Unity provides:
- **High-Fidelity Rendering**: Reflections, shadows, and materials.
- **Sensor Diversity**: Realistic depth cameras, semantic segmentation cameras.
- **Human Simulation**: Rich assets for simulating people interacting with robots.

## 7.2 Unity Robotics Hub

The **Unity Robotics Hub** is a suite of tools that includes:
- **URDF Importer**: Automatically converts your ROS URDF into a Unity GameObject.
- **ROS-TCP Connector**: A high-performance bridge to pass messages between Unity and ROS 2.

## 7.3 Synthetic Data Generation

One of Unity's biggest roles is creating training data for AI. We can:
- Randomize textures and lighting (Domain Randomization).
- Automatically label objects for object detection.
- Export thousands of images per hour for training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

## Hands-on: Exploring Unity Robotics

Check out the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub) tutorials to see how to bridge a simple robot to ROS 2.

### Key Takeaways
- Unity is chosen for its superior visual and sensor simulation.
- The Sim-to-Real gap is narrowed by realistic visual data.
- Unity enables the training of end-to-end AI policies in simulation.
