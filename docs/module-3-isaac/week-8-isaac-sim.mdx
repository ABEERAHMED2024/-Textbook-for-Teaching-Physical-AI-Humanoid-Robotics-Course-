## 8.1 The Power of GPU Simulation

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is built on **Omniverse**, a platform for real-time 3D collaboration. Unlike Gazebo (CPU-based), Isaac Sim offloads physics and rendering to the **GPU**, enabling:
- **Massive Parallelism**: Simulate thousands of robots simultaneously.
- **RTX Rendering**: Real-time ray tracing for perfect sensor simulation.
- **PhysX 5**: Advanced physics with deformable bodies and fluid simulation.

## 8.2 Universal Scene Description (USD)

Isaac Sim uses Pixar's **USD** as its native format. USD allows for:
- **Layering**: Multiple people working on the same scene simultaneously.
- **Interoperability**: Easy export/import from Maya, Blender, and 3ds Max.
- **Scalability**: Scenes with millions of objects.

## 8.3 Isaac Gym

For training humanoid locomotion, Isaac Sim integrates with **Isaac Gym**. This allows the robot to learn to walk through millions of trials in just a few hours of real-world time.

## Exercise: Running Isaac Sim

If you have an RTX GPU, launch Isaac Sim and open the "Hospital" or "Warehouse" demo environments.

### Key Takeaways
- Isaac Sim is the future of large-scale robotic AI training.
- GPU acceleration is mandatory for modern humanoid research.
