## 10.1 ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2)

**Nav2** is the state-of-the-art navigation framework for ROS 2. It handles:
- **Global Planning**: Finding the best path from A to B.
- **Local Planning**: Avoiding dynamic obstacles and following the global path.
- **Recovery Behaviors**: Handling situations where the robot gets stuck.

### Key Components of Nav2
- **Costmaps**: 2D or 3D grids representing obstacles.
- **Behavior Trees**: Advanced logic for managing navigation states.

## 10.2 Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Robotics

Classical controllers (like PID or MPC) require complex mathematical models. **RL** allows a robot to learn through trial and error.

### The RL Loop
1. **State**: The robot observes sensors.
2. **Action**: The robot takes a step.
3. **Reward**: The robot gets a "+" for staying upright and a "-" for falling.

## 10.3 Merging Nav2 and RL

Modern humanoids often use Nav2 for **high-level path planning** and RL for **low-level motor control (locomotion)**. This combination provides the best of both worlds: safety and adaptability.

## Hands-on: Navigating in a Map

Use the `ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py` to see Nav2 in action within a simulated environment.

### Key Takeaways
- Nav2 provides robust navigation for complex environments.
- Reinforcement Learning is the modern tool for complex locomotion tasks.
