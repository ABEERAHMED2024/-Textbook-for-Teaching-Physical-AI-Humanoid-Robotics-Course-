## 9.1 Hardware-Accelerated Perception

Standard ROS 2 perception nodes can be slow. **NVIDIA Isaac ROS** provides "GEMs"—highly optimized packages that offload computation to the GPU or specialized hardware (DLA/VIC) on NVIDIA chips.

### Key Isaac ROS GEMs
- **VSLAM**: Stereo or RGB-D based simultaneous localization and mapping.
- **Image Segmentation**: Deep learning-based object classification.
- **AprilTag**: High-speed detection of visual markers.

## 9.2 Visual SLAM (VSLAM)

Visual SLAM allows a robot to navigate in environments without GPS or expensive LiDAR by using camera feeds to:
1. **Track keyframes** in the environment.
2. **Estimate motion** between frames (Visual Odometry).
3. **Build a 3D map** and locate the robot within it.

## 9.3 Deploying to the Edge

For humanoid robots, carrying a powerful PC is difficult. We use **NVIDIA Jetson Orin** modules. Isaac ROS allows us to run complex AI models with low latency and low power consumption.

## Exercise: Running VSLAM in Simulation

In Isaac Sim, use the `isaac_ros_vslam` package to localize a robot in a virtual warehouse.

### Key Takeaways
- Hardware acceleration is the key to real-time perception.
- Isaac ROS provides the building blocks for autonomous navigation.
