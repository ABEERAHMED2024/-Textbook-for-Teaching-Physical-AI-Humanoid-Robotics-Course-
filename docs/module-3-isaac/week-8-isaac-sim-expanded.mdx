## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to install and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation. By the end, you'll have a functional Isaac Sim environment ready for advanced robotics development.

**Why this matters:** NVIDIA Isaac Sim provides photorealistic simulation capabilities that are essential for training AI models with synthetic data. This is particularly important for robotics applications where collecting real-world data is expensive or dangerous.

## Prerequisites and Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX GPU with at least 12GB VRAM (RTX 4070 Ti or higher recommended)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Windows 10/11
- **Software:** NVIDIA Omniverse installed, CUDA toolkit
- **Internet Connection:** Required for Isaac Sim download and asset downloads
- **Knowledge:** Understanding of Gazebo and Unity simulation environments

### Verify Your Environment

```bash
# Check if NVIDIA GPU is available
nvidia-smi
# Expected output: Information about your NVIDIA GPU

# Check CUDA installation
nvcc --version
# Expected output: CUDA compiler driver version information
```

## Step 1: Install NVIDIA Omniverse

Install the Omniverse platform which hosts Isaac Sim.

### Instructions

1. Visit the NVIDIA Omniverse website and download the Omniverse Launcher:
   - Go to https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/
   - Download and install the Omniverse Launcher

2. Launch the Omniverse Launcher and sign in with your NVIDIA developer account.

3. Install Isaac Sim from the Omniverse App Library:
   - Click on "CREATE" tab
   - Find "Isaac Sim" in the app library
   - Click "INSTALL" to download and install Isaac Sim

4. Alternatively, if you have access to the Isaac Sim Docker container:
   ```bash
   # Pull the Isaac Sim Docker image
   docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:latest
   ```

**Expected result:** Isaac Sim is installed and available in the Omniverse Launcher.

## Step 2: Launch Isaac Sim

Launch Isaac Sim and familiarize yourself with the interface.

### Instructions

1. Launch Isaac Sim from the Omniverse Launcher.

2. The first time you launch Isaac Sim, it will download additional assets. This may take some time depending on your internet connection.

3. Once loaded, you'll see the Isaac Sim interface with:
   - Viewport for 3D scene visualization
   - Stage panel showing the scene hierarchy
   - Property panel for adjusting object properties
   - Timeline for animation and simulation control

4. Create a new scene by selecting "File" → "New Scene".

**Expected result:** Isaac Sim launches successfully and displays the main interface.

## Step 3: Explore Isaac Sim Basics

Learn the basic operations in Isaac Sim.

### Instructions

1. **Scene Navigation:**
   - Orbit: Hold Alt + Left Mouse Button and drag
   - Pan: Hold Alt + Middle Mouse Button and drag
   - Zoom: Scroll Mouse Wheel or Alt + Right Mouse Button and drag vertically

2. **Adding Objects:**
   - In the "Create" menu, select "Geometry" → "Cube" to add a cube to the scene
   - Notice how the cube appears in both the viewport and the Stage panel

3. **Transforming Objects:**
   - Select the cube in the viewport or Stage panel
   - Use the transform gizmos (Move, Rotate, Scale) to modify the object
   - Adjust properties in the Property panel

4. **Running Simulation:**
   - Press the Play button in the timeline to start the physics simulation
   - Watch how objects interact with physics (gravity, collisions)

**Expected result:** You can navigate the scene, add objects, transform them, and run physics simulation.

## Step 4: Create a Simple Robot in Isaac Sim

Import or create a simple robot model in Isaac Sim.

### Instructions

1. **Using the Robot Generator:**
   - In the "Window" menu, select "Extensions" → "Isaac" → "Robot Generator"
   - Use the robot generator to create a simple wheeled robot
   - Configure the robot with appropriate dimensions and wheel properties

2. **Alternatively, import a URDF:**
   - If you have a URDF file from previous modules, you can import it:
   - In the "Window" menu, select "Extensions" → "URDF Importer"
   - Browse to your URDF file and import it
   - The robot should appear in the scene with all its joints and links

3. **Configure Differential Drive Controller:**
   - Select your robot in the Stage panel
   - In the Property panel, add a "Differential Controller" component
   - Configure the controller with appropriate wheel separation and radius values

4. **Add Sensors:**
   - Right-click on your robot in the Stage panel
   - Select "Add" → "Sensor" → "RGB Camera" to add a camera
   - Position the camera appropriately on your robot
   - You can also add other sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, etc.

**Expected result:** A robot model is created or imported with differential drive control and at least one sensor.

## Step 5: Set up a Basic Environment

Create a simple environment for your robot to navigate.

### Instructions

1. **Add Ground Plane:**
   - In the "Create" menu, select "Ground Plane"
   - Adjust the size as needed

2. **Add Obstacles:**
   - Add cubes, cylinders, or other shapes to create obstacles
   - Position them to create a simple maze or navigation challenge

3. **Configure Lighting:**
   - In the "Create" menu, select "Light" → "Distant Light" for sun-like lighting
   - Adjust intensity and direction as needed
   - You can also add dome lights or other light sources

4. **Add Textures and Materials:**
   - In the "Window" menu, open the "Content Browser"
   - Browse to available textures and materials
   - Apply different materials to your ground plane and obstacles for visual distinction

**Expected result:** A simple environment is created with ground, obstacles, lighting, and materials.

## Step 6: Control the Robot

Control your robot using Isaac Sim's scripting capabilities.

### Instructions

1. **Open the Script Editor:**
   - In the "Window" menu, select "Script Editor"

2. **Create a simple movement script:**
   ```python
   import omni
   from pxr import Gf
   import carb

   # Get the differential controller for your robot
   try:
       # Replace "my_robot" with your robot's prim path
       diff_controller = omni.isaac.wheeled_robots.controllers.DifferentialController(
           name="simple_diff_controller",
           wheel_radius=0.1,  # Adjust to match your robot
           wheel_base=0.4     # Adjust to match your robot
       )
       
       # Set target velocities (linear and angular)
       command = [1.0, 0.5]  # Move forward at 1 m/s with slight turn
       diff_controller.forward(command)
       
       print("Robot movement command sent!")
       
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error controlling robot: {e}")
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   - Paste the script in the Script Editor
   - Click the "Run" button
   - Your robot should start moving in the simulation

4. **Alternative: Use ROS 2 Bridge:**
   - Isaac Sim has built-in ROS 2 bridge capabilities
   - You can control your robot using ROS 2 topics like `/cmd_vel`
   - Enable the ROS 2 bridge extension in Isaac Sim

**Expected result:** Your robot moves in the simulation based on the control commands.

## Step 7: Capture Synthetic Data

Learn how to capture synthetic data from Isaac Sim.

### Instructions

1. **Camera Data:**
   - If you added an RGB camera to your robot, you can capture images
   - In the "Window" menu, open "Isaac Examples" → "Sensors" → "Camera Publisher"
   - This will publish camera images that can be captured and saved

2. **LiDAR Data:**
   - If you added a LiDAR sensor, you can capture point cloud data
   - Use the appropriate publisher extension for LiDAR data

3. **Data Logging:**
   - Isaac Sim can log various sensor data streams
   - Use the "Dataset Capture" extension to automatically collect sensor data
   - Configure the dataset capture with appropriate settings for your use case

4. **Synthetic Dataset Creation:**
   - Use the "Synthetic Data" extension to generate datasets
   - Configure parameters like lighting variations, object positions, etc.
   - Run the simulation to generate diverse synthetic data

**Expected result:** You can capture various types of sensor data from your simulation for AI training.
