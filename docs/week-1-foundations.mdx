## 1.1 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the transition from AI models that operate in purely digital environments (like LLMs or computer vision models running on static datasets) to agents that interact with and understand the physical world.

Traditional AI often lacks "grounding"—an understanding of gravity, friction, mass, and inertia. Physical AI bridges this gap by embedding intelligence into physical bodies (robots).

### The Four Pillars of Physical AI

1. **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors (LiDAR, Cameras).
2. **Cognition**: Planning and decision making using AI agents.
3. **Action**: Executing movements through actuators and motors.
4. **Embodiment**: The physical form that constrains and enables interaction.

## 1.2 Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's brain, its body, and its environment. In robotics, the "body" is not just a container for the AI but a critical part of how it solves problems.

> "The world is its own best model." — Rodney Brooks

## 1.3 Why Humanoids?

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in human-centered environments. Since our world is built for the human form (stairs, handles, tools), a humanoid form factor allows robots to integrate seamlessly into our existing infrastructure.

## Exercise: Identifying Physical Constraints

Look around your room. Identify three tasks that are easy for a human but difficult for a robot due to physical laws (e.g., picking up a slippery glass, navigating a cluttered rug).

### Key Takeaways
- Physical AI requires an understanding of physical laws.
- Embodiment is central to robotics.
- Humanoids are the ultimate platform for general-purpose physical agents.
