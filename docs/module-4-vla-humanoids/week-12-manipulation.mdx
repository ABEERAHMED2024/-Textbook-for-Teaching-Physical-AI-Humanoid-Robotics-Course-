# Week 12: Dexterous Manipulation & HRI

## 12.1 Dexterous Manipulation

Manipulation is the ability of a robot to move, rotate, or transform objects. For humanoids, this usually involves:
- **Motion Planning**: Avoiding self-collisions while reaching.
- **Grasp Planning**: Identifying the best points to apply pressure.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Understanding how hard the robot is squeezing.

## 12.2 Force & Impedance Control

In human environments, **position control** can be dangerous. If a robot hits a person, it will keep pushing until it reaches its target position. **Impedance control** makes the robot feel soft or compliant, allowing it to yield when it encounters unexpected resistance.

## 12.3 Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

Humanoids are social robots. They must understand:
- **Personal Space**: Not standing too close.
- **Gaze**: Looking at what they are interacting with.
- **Gesture**: Using arm movements to communicate intent.

## 12.4 Teleoperation

Teleoperation (controlling the robot remotely) is not just for use cases like remote surgery. In Physical AI, we use it to **collect data** of humans performing tasks, which we then use to train AI models via **Imitation Learning**.

## Exercise: Designing a Grasp

Research the difference between a **Power Grasp** and a **Precision Grasp**.

### Key Takeaways
- Manipulation is about interaction, not just motion.
- Force control is essential for safe operation in human spaces.
