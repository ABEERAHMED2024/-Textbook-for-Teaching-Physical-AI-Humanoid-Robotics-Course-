## 11.1 The Complexity of Humanoid Motion

Unlike a 4-wheeled robot, a humanoid is **inherently unstable**. It has a high Center of Mass (CoM) and a small support polygon (its feet). Keeping it upright requires high-frequency control loops.

## 11.2 Forward vs. Inverse Kinematics

- **Forward Kinematics (FK)**: From joint angles to end-effector position.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: From desired position to required joint angles. This is where the magic happens for humanoids picking up objects.

## 11.3 Balance: The Zero Moment Point (ZMP)

To walk without falling, the **ZMP** (the point where all forces exerted on the ground result in no moment) must stay within the support polygon. If the ZMP leaves the footprint, the robot tips over.

## 11.4 Bipedal Locomotion

Walking consists of:
1. **Double Support Phase**: Both feet on the ground.
2. **Single Support Phase**: One foot swinging forward.
3. **Transition**: Shifting weight.

## Exercise: Solving 3-DOF IK

Try to manually calculate the joint angles for a 2D planar arm to reach a target point (X, Y).

### Key Takeaways
- Humanoids are high-DOF systems that require sophisticated IK solvers.
- Balance is the most critical challenge in humanoid robotics.
