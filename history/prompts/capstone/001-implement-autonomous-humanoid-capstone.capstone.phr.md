# Prompt History Record (PHR)

## Prompt Text
I need to implement the Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project as defined in `docs/capstone/autonomous-humanoid.md`. This is a comprehensive integration of the entire course.

Please generate a complete implementation plan and execute the initial setup.

Input context:
- `docs/capstone/autonomous-humanoid.md`: The master guide for the project.

Required work to be done:
1.  **Analyze Requirements**: Read the capstone guide and extract all requirements, deliverables, and timelines.
2.  **Create Specs & Plans**:
    -   Create `specs/capstone/spec.md`: Define the detailed technical specification for the Voice-to-Action pipeline, including interfaces for Voice, Planning, Navigation, Perception, and Manipulation modules.
    -   Create `specs/capstone/plan.md`: Create a phased implementation plan matching the 7-week schedule.
    -   Create `specs/capstone/tasks.md`: Break down Phase 1 (System Design) and Phase 2 (Component Implementation) into granular, actionable tasks.
3.  **Project Setup**:
    -   Create the directory structure for the capstone project (e.g., `src/capstone`, `src/pkg/voice`, etc. matching the architecture).
    -   Initialize the ROS 2 workspace/packages if not already present.
4.  **Execute Phase 1 (System Design)**:
    -   Create the System Architecture Diagram (Mermaid).
    -   Document Component Interface Specifications.
    -   Select and document the Technology Stack.
    -   Perform Risk Assessment.
5.  **Prepare for Phase 2**:
    -   Set up the development environment (Docker/DevContainer) as specified.

Please start by creating the `specs/capstone/` directory and drafting the `spec.md` and `plan.md` for my review.
